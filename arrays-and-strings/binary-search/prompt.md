# Binary Search

Given a sorted array of integers, return the index of the given key. Return -1 if not found.

## [Solution (JS)](./index.js)

## Recursive

### Runtime Complexity

Logarithmic, O(logn).

### Memory Complexity

Logarithmic, O(logn).

Recursive solution has O(logn) memory complexity as it will consume memory on the stack.

## Iterative

### Runtime Complexity

Logarithmic, O(logn).

### Memory Complexity

Constant, O(1).

Iterative solution has same O(logn) runtime complexity as the recursive solution but has better memory complexity.
